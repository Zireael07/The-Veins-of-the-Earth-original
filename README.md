Key features:

Based on the OGL license
If you've ever played any of the games released on the Open Game Licence, whether computer or tabletop, you will find many things familiar. Same if you played any AD&D-derived games (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Angband)...

Tiles
The game uses freely available tiles which have been used in several Angband variants, so they are tried and proven.

Tooltips
Don't know what that spell or ability or monster is? Just mouse over it. Lots of readily accessible info for the player.

Help
Still stuck? Press F1 or H.

Turn-based
You make your action and enemies take theirs.

Grid-based
In true roguelike spirit.
